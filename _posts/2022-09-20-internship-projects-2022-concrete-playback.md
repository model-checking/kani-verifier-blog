title:  "Internship Projects 2022: Concrete Playback"
---

Today we're starting a series of posts about the internship projects carried out
in our team during 2022. The Kani team is proud to be part of the AWS Automated
Reasoning teams, which every year hosts a number of interns to work on
automated-reasoning projects for tools like Kani. More details on AWS Automated
Reasoning areas of work and available locations can be found here. If you're a
Masters or PhD interested in Automated Reasoning, please consider applying to
the following openings:
 * [2023 Applied Science Internship (Master's student)](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/jobs/2173429/2023-applied-science-internship-automated-reasoning-united-states)
 * [2023 Applied Science Internship (PhD student)](https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/jobs/1882106/applied-scientist-automated-reasoning-group)

> This internship project was executed by 
[Sanjit Bhat](https://sanjit-bhat.github.io/). Sanjit joined the Kani team as an SDE Intern
while finishing his undergraduate studies at [UT
Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and is now a PhD student at
[MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). We wish him the best in his PhD studies!

## Proof Debugging

We commonly use the term **Proof Debugging** to refer to the process of
debugging failing proofs that we expected to succeed.
The process isn't very different to debugging unit tests: There's one or more errors
due to assumptions made about the function under test, and how the inputs and/or outputs
relate to that function. The goal then is to find what assumption was made and
correct it accordingly.

Let's talk about how tooling can make this process easier for users.

### CBMC Viewer

As you may know, Kani uses [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) to perform
the main analysis required for verification. When one or more checks have failed,
that's a verification failure. In these cases, CBMC can return a text-based
trace which includes the sequence of steps leading to the failed check. We often
call this a (proof) counter-example.

At the moment, the main tool for proof debugging in Kani is
[`cbmc-viewer`](https://github.com/model-checking/cbmc-viewer). `cbmc-viewer` is
an open-source tool that scans different formats of CBMC traces and produces a
browsable HTML report based on that output. Thanks to this tool, the trace can
be seen in a regular HTML browser:

<img src="{{site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}/assets/images/kani-rectangle-cex.png"/>

However, CBMC traces for real-world examples may include a huge number of steps.
This means proof debugging is difficult, as the user has to identify
what steps are relevant to the proof failure and understand at a high-level what
the trace is computing (i.e., the user has to _interpret_ the whole trace).

This made us think:

> Wouldn't it be great to get those values automatically?
> Or even better, could we generate programs that exercise the path in that particular trace?

We realized this would ease proof debugging for many users, so we set ourselves
to design and develop such a feature for Kani.

## Concrete Playback

### An example

Remember [the rectangle example we used in our announcement](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2022/05/04/announcing-the-kani-rust-verifier-project.html#a-simple-example)?
We will use the same example to illustrate how concrete playback works. Feel free to [skip up to the next section](#concrete-playback-in-action) if you're familiar with it.

As a quick reminder, we started with the `Rectangle` implementation from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/):

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }

    fn stretch(&self, factor: u64) -> Option<Self> {
        let w = self.width.checked_mul(factor)?;
        let h = self.height.checked_mul(factor)?;
        Some(Rectangle { width: w, height: h })
    }
}
```

And this is the harness we wrote:

```rust
#[kani::proof]
pub fn stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original() {
    let original = Rectangle { width: kani::any(), height: kani::any() };
    let factor = kani::any();
    if let Some(larger) = original.stretch(factor) {
        assert!(larger.can_hold(&original));
    }
}
```

Note that verification will fail when the harness above is run with Kani:

```bash
cargo kani --harness stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original
# --snip--
VERIFICATION:- FAILED
```

If we run the command with `--visualize`, `cbmc-viewer` would generate the
report we showed in [the CBMC Viewer section](#cbmc-viewer). The highlighted
step there, which assigns `factor = 0ul`, is the concrete value we'd look for.

Now we'll see how to run concrete playback on this example.

### Concrete playback in action

In order to run the concrete playback, we have to invoke Kani with the `--concrete-playback=<mode>` flag.
Here, `mode` can be either `print` or `inplace`.
Also, because concrete playback is an unstable feature, we'll need to pass `--enable-unstable` in addition to the other flags.

Let's try the `print` mode first!

```bash
cargo kani --harness stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original --enable-unstable --concrete-playback=print
```

Aside from the usual results, we now see additional output:

````
INFO: Parsing concrete values from property `rectangle::stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original.assertion.1` with description `assertion failed: larger.can_hold(&original)`.
Concrete playback unit test for `stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original`:
```
#[test]
fn kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517() {
    let concrete_vals: Vec<Vec<u8>> = vec![
        // 0ul
        vec![0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        // 301283365829122ul
        vec![2, 58, 255, 255, 3, 18, 1, 0],
        // 36573ul
        vec![221, 142, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ];
    kani::concrete_playback_run(concrete_vals, stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original);
}
```
INFO: To automatically add the concrete playback unit test `kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517` to the src code, run Kani with `--concrete-playback=InPlace`.
````

With the `print` mode, concrete playback generates a Rust unit test that:
 1. Initializes a vector of byte vectors with concrete values.
 2. Runs the harness we tested with those concrete values.

The way the vector `concrete_vals` is initialized may be confusing at first.
But if you look closely, you'll realize that each vector contained in the main
vector is a sequence of eight bytes (or `u8` values), which is just another way
to represent a `u64` value. In summary, Kani requires each variable assigned
`kani::any()` in our harness (`factor`, `width`, and `height`) to be initialized
byte by byte, and that's why we need three 8-byte vectors.
Because bytes are not easy to read for humans, we add a comment above each bytes
vector with the value it represents.

Now let's run Kani with the `inplace` mode:

```bash
cargo kani --harness stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original --enable-unstable --concrete-playback=inplace
# --snip--
INFO: Parsing concrete values from property `rectangle::stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original.assertion.1` with description `assertion failed: larger.can_hold(&original)`.
INFO: Now modifying the source code to include the concrete playback unit test `kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517`.
```

The test unit that was printed out is now added to the source code
automatically! Now we can run the test that Kani inserted into
the source code, which can be done[^footnote-setup] with the default
command for running Rust unit tests:

```
 cargo +nightly test
```

```
running 1 test
test rectangle::tests::kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517 ... FAILED

failures:

---- rectangle::tests::kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517 stdout ----
thread 'rectangle::tests::kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517' panicked at 'assertion failed: larger.can_hold(&original)', src/rectangle.rs:36:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace


failures:
    rectangle::tests::kani_concrete_playback_stretched_rectangle_can_hold_original_11077055701284606517

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

There are some neat details about this mode that have implemented after watching
our users trying the feature.
For example, the name of the test contains a _hash value_ that depends on the
concrete values, to avoid having repeated unit tests in the code.
Another improvement is that Kani will format the code with `rustfmt` after
adding the test to the source code, so we keep it formatted at all times.



### How it all works

We won't go in detail about how the concrete playback feature works, but here's an overview of the main tasks for this project:
 1. Implement parsing of CBMC traces to retrieve concrete values from `kani::any()` variable initializations.
 2. Provide an alternative implementation of `kani::any()` which initializes
 variables using the concrete values collected using the implementation in (1).
 3. Add the logic to print, format, and (optionally) write a Rust unit test with
 the extracted concrete values. 
 4. Add a flag for the concrete playback feature, and extend Kani's workflow to
 perform the previous tasks automatically when using that flag.

That should give you an idea of how the project was structured.

Please go ahead and try the concrete playback feature yourself!

Note that it comes with a few limitations explained [here](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/debugging-verification-failures.html#limitations).
We have other improvements in mind for it, but let us know if you have
[any ideas](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/debugging-verification-failures.html#request-for-comments).
We especially encourage you to [file a bug report](https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) if you come across any error when using it as well.

Overall, we had a lot of fun working with Sanjit on this project, and we're confident
it'll be very useful for Kani users in the future!
